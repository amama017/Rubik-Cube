# Rubik-Cube
ES-based Rubik's Cube solver

Rubik's cube is a very challenging problem in Evolutionary Computations (EC) for its huge search space. This paper presents the development of Evolutionary Strategy ES approach using Herdy's mutation-only operations to search for a solution sequence regarding any scrambled cube. Distance between current cube state and the goal state is defined as fitness function. Fitness function is used to represent cube dificulty in performance evaluation. Different population size and number of parents are applied; to study the effect of exploration and exploitation rates on ES performance using different (mu; lambda) selection configurations.
